# Univ-Bench Artificial Data Generator (UBA)
 
Data Generator for the LUBM Benchmark, this is basically the official code for the generator with some minor tweaks:

- `generate.sh` script for launching
- `pom.xml` and changed directory structure to be able to build with Maven
- Added `-out <dir>` option to control where generated data files are written
- Bug fix to use OS specific file separator

## Usage

    > ./generate.sh options
   
Running without any `options` will print the usage summary

Note that the default ontology URL usually passed to the `-onto` argument is `http://swat.cse.lehigh.edu/onto/univ-bench.owl`
